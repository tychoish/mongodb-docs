planCacheSetFilter

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Definition
----------

.. dbcommand:: planCacheSetFilter

   .. versionadded:: 2.6

   Set an :ref:`index filter <index-filters>` for a collection. If
   an index filter already exists for the :term:`query shape`, the
   command overrides the previous index filter.

   The command has the following syntax:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.runCommand(
         {
            planCacheSetFilter: <collection>,
            query: <query>,
            sort: <sort>,
            projection: <projection>,
            indexes: [ <index1>, <index2>, ...]
         }
      )

   The :dbcommand:`planCacheSetFilter` command has the following field:

   .. include:: planCacheSetFilter-field.rst

   Index filters only exist for the duration of the server process and
   do not persist after shutdown; however, you can also clear existing
   index filters using the :dbcommand:`planCacheClearFilters` command.

Required Access
---------------

A user must have access that includes the
:authaction:`planCacheIndexFilter` action.

Examples
--------

The following example creates an index filter on the ``orders``
collection such that for queries that consists only of an equality
match on the ``status`` field without any projection and sort, the
query optimizer evaluates only the two specified indexes and the
collection scan for the winning plan:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.runCommand(
      {
         planCacheSetFilter: "orders",
         query: { status: "A" },
         indexes: [
            { cust_id: 1, status: 1 },
            { status: 1, order_date: -1 }
         ]
      }
   )

In the query predicate, only the structure of the predicate, including
the field names, are significant; the values are insignificant. As
such, the created filter applies to the following operations:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.orders.find( { status: "D" } )
   db.orders.find( { status: "P" } )

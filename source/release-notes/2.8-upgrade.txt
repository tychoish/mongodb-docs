======================
Upgrade MongoDB to 2.8
======================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

MongoDB 2.8 is currently in development. While 2.8-release-candidates
are currently available, these versions of MongoDB are for **testing
only and not for production use**.

In the general case, the upgrade from MongoDB 2.6 to 2.8 is a
binary-compatible "drop-in" upgrade: shut down the :program:`mongod`
instances and replace them with :program:`mongod` instances running
2.8. **However**, before you attempt any upgrade please familiarize
yourself with the content of this document, particularly the procedure
for :ref:`upgrading sharded clusters <2.8-upgrade-cluster>`.

.. _2.8-upgrade-considerations:

Upgrade Recommendations and Checklists
--------------------------------------

When upgrading, consider the following:

Upgrade Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To upgrade an existing MongoDB deployment to 2.8, you must be running
2.6. If you're running a version of MongoDB before 2.6, you *must*
upgrade to 2.6 before upgrading to 2.8. See
:doc:`/release-notes/2.6-upgrade` for the procedure to upgrade from 2.4
to 2.6. Once upgraded to MongoDB 2.6, you **cannot** downgrade to any
version earlier than MongoDB 2.4.

Preparedness
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before upgrading MongoDB, always test your application in a staging
environment before deploying the upgrade to your production
environment.

Downgrade Limitations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once upgraded to MongoDB 2.8, you **cannot** downgrade to a version
lower than 2.6.5.

If you upgrade to 2.8 and have run :dbcommand:`authSchemaUpgrade`, you
**cannot* downgrade to 2.6 without disabling :option:`--auth`.

Package Upgrades
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you installed MongoDB from the MongoDB ``apt`` or ``yum`` repositories,
upgrade to 2.8 using the package manager.

For Debian, Ubuntu, and related operating systems, type these commands:

.. code-block:: javascript

   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install mongodb-org

For Red Hat Enterprise, CentOS, Fedora, or Amazon Linux:

.. code-block:: javascript

   sudo yum install mongodb-org

If you did not install the ``mongodb-org`` package, and installed a subset
of MongoDB components replace ``mongodb-org`` in the commands above with
the appropriate package names.

See installation instructions for :doc:`Ubuntu
</tutorial/install-mongodb-on-ubuntu>`, :doc:`RHEL
</tutorial/install-mongodb-on-red-hat-centos-or-fedora-linux>`,
:doc:`Debian </tutorial/install-mongodb-on-debian>`, or :doc:`other Linux
Systems </tutorial/install-mongodb-on-linux>` for a list of the available
packages and complete MongoDB installation instructions.

Upgrade MongoDB Processes
-------------------------

.. _2.8-upgrade-standalone:

Upgrade Standalone ``mongod`` Instance to MongoDB 2.8
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following steps outline the procedure to upgrade a standalone
:program:`mongod` from version 2.6 to 2.8. To upgrade from version
2.4 to 2.8, :doc:`upgrade to version 2.6
</release-notes/2.6-upgrade>` *first*, and then follow the procedure to
upgrade from 2.6 to 2.8.

#. Download binaries of the latest release in the 2.8 series from the
   `MongoDB Download Page`_. See :doc:`/installation` for more
   information.

#. Shut down your :program:`mongod` instance. Replace the existing
   binary with the 2.8 :program:`mongod` binary and restart :program:`mongod`.

.. _`MongoDB Download Page`: http://www.mongodb.org/downloads

.. _2.8-upgrade-replica-set:

Upgrade a Replica Set to 2.8
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. NOTE: oplog incompatibility issue that means that oplog entries
   generated before 2.2.1 cannot be in the oplog before upgrading to
   2.8, which means you have to wait for the entries to be overwritten
   by later versions. Link to compatibility page when exists.

The following steps outline the procedure to upgrade a replica set from
MongoDB 2.6 to MongoDB 2.8. To upgrade from MongoDB 2.6 to 2.8,
:doc:`upgrade all members of the replica set to version 2.6
</release-notes/2.6-upgrade>` *first*, and then follow the procedure to
upgrade from MongoDB 2.6 to 2.8.

You can upgrade from MongoDB 2.6 to 2.8 using a "rolling" upgrade to
minimize downtime by upgrading the members individually while the other
members are available:

.. include:: /includes/steps/2.8-upgrade-replica-set.rst

Replica set failover is not instant and will render the set
unavailable to accept writes until the failover process
completes. This may take 30 seconds or more: schedule the
upgrade procedure during a scheduled maintenance window..

.. _2.8-upgrade-cluster:

Upgrade a Sharded Cluster to 2.8
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Only upgrade sharded clusters to 2.8 if **all** members of the
cluster are currently running instances of 2.6. The only supported
upgrade path for sharded clusters running 2.4 is via 2.6. The upgrade
process checks all components of the cluster and will produce warnings
if any component is running version 2.4.

Considerations
``````````````

The upgrade process does not require any downtime. However, while you
upgrade the sharded cluster, ensure that clients do not make changes
to the collection meta-data. For example, during the upgrade, do **not**
do any of the following:

- :method:`sh.enableSharding()`

- :method:`sh.shardCollection()`

- :method:`sh.addShard()`

- :method:`db.createCollection()`

- :method:`db.collection.drop()`

- :method:`db.dropDatabase()`

- any operation that creates a database

- any other operation that modifies the cluster metadata in any
  way. See :doc:`/reference/sharding` for a complete list
  of sharding commands. Note, however, that not all commands on
  the :doc:`/reference/sharding` page modifies the
  cluster meta-data.

Upgrade Sharded Clusters
````````````````````````

*Optional but Recommended.* As a precaution, take a backup of the
``config`` database *before* upgrading the sharded cluster.

.. include:: /includes/steps/2.8-upgrade-sharded-cluster.rst

.. _2.8-finalize-shard-cluster-upgrade:

Complete Sharded Cluster Upgrade
````````````````````````````````

After you have successfully upgraded *all* :program:`mongos` instances,
you can upgrade the other instances in your MongoDB deployment.

.. warning::

   Do not upgrade :program:`mongod` instances until after you have
   upgraded *all* :program:`mongos` instances.

While the balancer is still disabled, upgrade the components of your
sharded cluster in the following order:

- Upgrade all 3 :program:`mongod` config server instances, leaving
  the *first* system in the :option:`mongos --configdb` argument to upgrade
  *last*.

- Upgrade each shard, one at a time, upgrading the :program:`mongod`
  secondaries before running :dbcommand:`replSetStepDown` and
  upgrading the primary of each shard.

When this process is complete, :ref:`re-enable the
balancer <sharding-balancing-enable>`.

Removed Commands
----------------

In 2.8, the following internal commands are no longer available:

- ``closeAllDatabases``

- ``getoptime``

``db.addUser()`` Removed
------------------------

2.8 removes the legacy ``db.addUser()`` method. Use
:method:`db.createUser()` and :method:`db.updateUser()` instead..

Storage Engine Configuration File Options
-----------------------------------------

With the introduction of additional storage engines in 2.8, some
options moved in the configuration file schema. Consider the following
changes:

- ``storage.directoryPerDB`` becomes :setting:`storage.mmapv1.directoryPerDB`
- ``storagejournal.commitIntervalMs`` becomes :setting:`storage.mmapv1.journal.commitIntervalMs`
- ``storagejournal.debugFlags`` becomes :setting:`storage.mmapv1.journal.debugFlags`
- ``storagensSize`` becomes :setting:`storage.mmapv1.nsSize`
- ``storagepreallocDataFiles`` becomes :setting:`storage.mmapv1.preallocDataFiles`
- ``storagequota.enforced`` becomes :setting:`storage.mmapv1.quota.enforced`
- ``storagequota.maxFilesPerDB`` becomes :setting:`storage.mmapv1.quota.maxFilesPerDB`
- ``storagesmallFiles`` becomes :setting:`storage.mmapv1.smallFiles`
- ``storagesyncPeriodSecs`` becomes :setting:`storage.mmapv1.syncPeriodSecs`

2.8 :program:`mongod` instances are backwards compatible with existing
configuration files, but will issue warnings when if you attempt to
use the old settings.

Replica Set State Change
------------------------

The ``FATAL`` replica set state does not exist as of 2.8.0.

Replica Set Oplog Format Change
-------------------------------

.. TODO: link this section to the upgrade instructions.

MongoDB 2.8 is not compatible with oplog entries generated by versions
of MongoDB before 2.2.1. If you upgrade from one of these versions,
you must wait for new oplog entries to overwrite *all* old oplog
entries generated by one of these versions before upgrading to 2.8.0
or earlier.

Replica Set Configuration Validation
------------------------------------

MongoDB now provides more strict validation of :doc:`replica set
configuration objects </reference/replica-configuration>`. Of
particular note are the following alterations:

- Arbiters may only have ``1`` vote. Previously arbiters could have
  ``0`` votes, which is not supported.

Shell: Authentication Compatibility
-----------------------------------

Versions of the :program:`mongo` shell before 2.8, are *not*
compatible with 2.8 deployments of MongoDB that enforce access
control. If you have a 2.8 MongoDB deployment that requires
authentication you must use 2.8 versions of the :program:`mongo`
shell.

Shell: Collection and Index Listing with ``wiredtiger`` and Older Shells
------------------------------------------------------------------------

With the ``wiredtiger`` storage engine, and versions of
the :program:`mongo` shell before ``2.8.0``, the
:method:`db.getCollectionNames()` (along with ``show collections`` and
``show tables``) and as well as :method:`db.collection.getIndexes()`
return no output.

Use the :program:`mongo` shell from a 2.8 distribution when connecting
to :program:`mongod` instances that use ``wiredtiger``.

Changes to Restart Behavior during Background Indexing
------------------------------------------------------

For 2.8 :program:`mongod` instances, if a background index build is in
progress when the :program:`mongod` process terminates, when the
instance restarts the index build will restart as foreground index
build. If the index build encounters any errors, such as a duplicate
key error, the :program:`mongod` will exit with an error.

To start the :program:`mongod` after a failed index build, use the
:setting:`storage.indexBuildRetry` or :option:`--noIndexBuildRetry
<mongod --noIndexBuildRetry>` to skip the index build on start up.

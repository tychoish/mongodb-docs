Replica Set State Change

Replica Set Oplog Format Change
-------------------------------

.. TODO: link this section to the upgrade instructions.

MongoDB 2.8 is not compatible with oplog entries generated by versions
of MongoDB before 2.2.1. If you upgrade from one of these versions,
you must wait for new oplog entries to overwrite *all* old oplog
entries generated by one of these versions before upgrading to 2.8.0
or earlier.
